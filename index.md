title: "About me"
---

Model-based microeconomist focused on designing economic models that support decision-making and explain market behavior.

I currently serve as an Economic Modeling Advisor, where I develop and apply quantitative tools to help stakeholders assess complex economic systems. My work draws on computational techniques such as general equilibrium (GE) models, gravity models of trade, Bayesian methods, calibrated likelihood frameworks, and stochastic analysis. I focus on translating economic theory into practical tools that inform policy and strategy.

Previously, I worked as a Research Agricultural Economist at the USDA Economic Research Service, where I analyzed food systems and their implications for farmer welfare and human health. My research there examined how modeling assumptions influence our understanding of food markets.

I hold a Ph.D. in Agricultural and Applied Economics from the University of Illinois, with methodological expertise in Bayesian inference, likelihood-based estimation, and general equilibrium simulations.

studying food systems and their implications for farmers' welfare and human health.

I joined the USDA Economic Research Service as a research agricultural economist for the Agricultural Policy & Models Branch in the Market & Trade Economics Division. I hold a Ph.D. in Agricultural and Applied Economics from the University of Illinois.

My work explores the opportunities and limitations of methodological advancements to accurately reflect food markets. I strive to understand how market assumptions have implications for the Mathematical modeling of consumers and producers. For this purpose, I employ computational methodologies such as Bayesian methods, specific-case parametrization of log-likelihood functions, and G.E. simulations to inform food policy.

Outside economics, I am a geo-politics nerd (including non-fictional regions) who enjoys hiking and travel, and a podcast listener who walks from 4pm to 5pm every day. In Winters, I hibernate, but mostly I remote-work and play video games. Currently reading Daniel Kahneman's *Thinking, Fast and Slow*.
