Model-based microeconomist studying food systems and their implications for farmers' welfare and human health.

I joined the USDA Economic Research Service as a research agricultural economist for the Agricultural Policy & Models Branch in the Market & Trade Economics Division. I hold a Ph.D. in Agricultural and Applied Economics from the University of Illinois.

My work explores the opportunities and limitations of methodological advancements to accurately reflect food markets. I strive to understand how market assumptions have implications for the Mathematical modeling of consumers and producers. For this purpose, I employ computational methodologies such as Bayesian methods, specific-case parametrization of log-likelihood functions, and G.E. simulations to inform food policy. 

Outside economics, I am a geo-politics nerd (including non-fictional regions) who enjoys hiking and travel, and a podcast listener who walks from 4pm to 5pm every day. In Winters, I hibernate, but mostly I remote-work and play video games. Currently reading Daniel Kahneman''s *Thinking, Fast and Slow*.

#### I will be presenting my work on the poverty implications of the recent food price escalation in México, *Alleviating the poverty implications of the 2021 food price escalation in México*, at the AAEA 2022 in Anaheim, CA.

##### (Current) Abstract

All countries experienced significant food price increases from supply chain disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic that may have severe food security repercussions. When it comes to developing countries where datasets are often unavailable, different approaches are required to proactively identify and alleviate poverty effects from price escalations. This manuscript uses the National Household Survey of Incomes and Expenditure to quantify the food security needs from price spikes in Mexican households. We estimate a complete food demand system that accounts for the substitution effects across food items to accurately calculate the cost of a poverty alleviation policy tailored to the recent price escalation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings reveal that in 2021, the price of food increased such that Mexican households require an additional 9% increase in their food budgets to keep a level of welfare like that of the beginning of the year. Demographic comparisons reveal that households led by women require additional monetary aid regardless of geographic location. We find that the cost of alleviating the poverty effects in México caused by the recent price escalation to be $48.6 billion pesos ($2.4 billion dollars). Because of the high price tag, we group Mexican states by the level of income compensation required to distribute to each family and propose an efficient allocation of transfer payments to reduce the cost of poverty alleviation.
