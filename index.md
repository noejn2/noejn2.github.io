Model-based microeconomist studying food systems and their implications for farmers' welfare and human health.

I joined the USDA Economic Research Service as a research agricultural economist for the Agricultural Policy & Models Branch in the Market & Trade Economics Division. I hold a Ph.D. in Agricultural and Applied Economics from the University of Illinois.

My work explores the opportunities and limitations of methodological advancements to accurately reflect food markets. I strive to understand how market assumptions have implications for the Mathematical modeling of consumers and producers. For this purpose, I employ computational methodologies such as Bayesian methods, specific-case parametrization of log-likelihood functions, and G.E. simulations to inform food policy. 

Outside economics, I am a geo-politics nerd (including non-fictional regions) who enjoys hiking and travel, and a podcast listener who walks from 4pm to 5pm every day. In Winters, I hibernate, but mostly I remote-work and play video games. Currently reading Daniel Kahneman's *Thinking, Fast and Slow*.

#### I will be presenting my work on Bayesian modeling of crop yield potential in the U.S., *The probabilistic role of climate change on crop yield potential.*, at the FCSM 2022 in DC.
##### (Current) Abstract

A Bayesian hierarchical model of crop yields that integrates agronomic evidence of how climate change affects crop growth is developed to study U.S. county-level production trends. Posterior distributions relevant to corn and soybean production in the U.S. and weather forecasts from the most recent Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change report are employed to study crop yield potential for the next decade. Corn and soybean yield potential simulations indicate that increasing temperatures in the U.S. have the potential to put an end to the upward trend in crop productivity documented in previous studies within the next decade. Projections from Midwestern and Eastern U.S. counties for 2022, 2027, and 2032 indicate that the decline in crop yield potential is driven by large cereal producers in the corn belt, including counties in Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana.
