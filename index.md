It will be updated soon.

I am a Ph. D. candidate in applied economics at the University of Illinois. I am interested in studying Food Systems and their implications for the environment and health with a focus on the NAFTA (now USMCA) region. I strive to study empirical issues from a structural modeling approach to inform public policy. I work with large datasets of climatological, land use, and economic indicators regarding U.S. farmersâ€™ lands. I am also experienced in the estimation of price and income elasticities using censored AIDS and QUAIDS, counterfactual simulations using general equilibrium models of trade, and input-output structural decomposition analyses with regional and multi-regional databases.

### I will be attending NARSC 2021 Denver, Colorado to present my manuscript *Revisiting the impact of climate change on agriculture through spatially-varying and place-tailored Ricardian estimates*

Paper with [Sandy Dall'Erba](https://ace.illinois.edu/directory/dallerba), [Chang Cai](https://ace.illinois.edu/directory/ccai5) and [A. Stewart Fotheringham](https://sgsup.asu.edu/stewart-fotheringham).

The Ricardian framework has been widely used to study the impact of climate change on agriculture across the world due to its relatively simple implementation: A reduced-form hedonic specification to calibrate such an impact over a single cross-section of data. The role of the spatial heterogeneity i.e., the impact of climate is space-dependent, is well-accepted, but the literature struggle to reach an agreement on how to model it. A recent study finds that different group-memberships found in the literature i.e., a researcher's ex-ante assumption to classify spatial-units based on how they interact with climate, lead to a wide range of forecasted impacts \citep{caidall21groups}. This paper employs the Multiscale Geographically-Weighted-Regression (MGWR) to avoid setting an a priori definition of heterogeneity and to generate county-specific marginal effects of climate change impacts. We construct an updated dataset found in \citet{mendelsohn1994impact}, employ our estimator choice and compare our results with those found in different hedonic studies that employ group-memberships in U.S. agriculture. Our cross-validation exercise indicate that our MGWR approach has a higher predictive power than studies that cluster spatial units, suggesting that climate damage forecast of agriculture can improve by the employmet of the MGWR.
