I am a Ph. D. candidate in applied economics at the University of Illinois. I am interested in studying Food Systems and their implications for environment and health with a focus in the NAFTA (now USMCA) region. I strive to study empirical issues from a structural modelling approach to inform public policy. I work with large datasets of climatological, land use and economic indicators regarding U.S. farmers' lands. I am also experienced in estimation of price and income elasticities using censored AIDS and QUAIDS, counterfactual simulations using general equilibrium models of trade and input-output structural decomposition analyses with regional and multi-regional databases.

### My job market paper's title *A model of U.S. domestic crop trade to study state's food vulnerability to supply chain disruptions*

Paper with prof. [William Ridley](https://ace.illinois.edu/directory/wridley) and prof. [Sandy Dall'Erba](https://ace.illinois.edu/directory/dallerba).

This manuscript expands a Ricardian trade general equilibrium model to assess the current U.S. domestic food system vulnerabilities to supply chain disruptions. Our model incorporates assumptions about the heterogeneity of farmers' production and recognizes food processing plants as the main consumer of farmers' crops, isolating their substitution effect. In addition, we construct a ranking of U.S. states' relative comparative advantage in the domestic market for crops, which is decomposed into an expenditure and a productivity terms. Our ranking sheds light on the determinants of the initial composition of U.S. state's consumption sources and how they affect welfare losses in our food vulnerability simulations. We find that the distribution of welfare losses caused by disruptions in the existing supply chains depends on a state's ability to substitute imports for domestic production. In turn, a state's ability to substitute imports for domestic production is determined by its comparative advantage; the state's agricultural capacity adjusted by its operating expenses per harvested acre. We conduct an additional simulation to investigate the ability of the existing food supply chain to mitigate welfare losses from events that affect each states' ability to produce crops.
