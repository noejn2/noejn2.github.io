title: "About me"

I am an applied microeconomist studying food systems and their implications for the environment and human health. I strive to study empirical issues from a structural modeling approach to inform public policy. I constantly research how new methodologies can answer research questions, and currently I am working with Bayesian econometrics and gravity trade model applications on domestic trade. A personal interest of me is food insecurity in México and the U.S.

I work as a Research Agricultural Economist at the USDA Economic Research Service. I finished my Ph.D. in Applied and Agricultural Economics at the University of Illinois in December 2021. Before that, I was an intern at the USDA Rural Development and later at NASS.

Outside economics, I am geo-politics nerd (including non-fictional regions) who enjoys hiking and travel, and a podcast listener who walks from 4pm to 5pm everyday. In Winters, I hibernate, but mostly I remote-work and play videogames. Currently reading John Green's *The Anthropocene Reviewed: Essays on a Human-Centered Planet*.
#### I am organizing a track session on *Identification in Demand Estimations* for the AAEA 2022 in Anaheim, CA, where I will be presenting my manuscript *The effects of taxing sugary soft beverages in México: A censored QUAI demand system approach*.

##### Abstract

The theoretical foundations and procedures to estimate demand systems to recover income- and price-elasticities have long been established; however, some streams of the literature do not account for all of the empirical implications of their datasets, leading to inconclusive results. The analysis of sin taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) is an exemplary case that has carried controversy in Latin-American countries. In México, for instance, the federal government imposed a 20% price hike on SSB to curb its obesity epidemic in 2014, but obesity has continued increasing. This manuscript revisits the demand estimation applications aim to study the effectiveness of the sin tax with a censored Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand (QUAID) system. Previous studies find that SSB is an elastic good (a 10% price increase is associated with a greater than 10% reduction in quantity) with an own-price elasticity between -1.11 and -1.61. By employing our rigorous estimation procedure, our study finds that SSB is an inelastic good with an own-price elasticity between -0.83 and -0.98. Our results suggest that SSB taxes are not as effective as previous research indicates, explaining the gap between actual obesity rates and expected obesity rates after the sin tax was imposed in México.
