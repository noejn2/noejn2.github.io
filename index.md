Economic Modeling Advisor providing technical assistance and capacity development to government institutions on quantitative trade policy modeling and analysis.

I advise government ministries on developing and deploying computable general equilibrium (CGE) models to assess the economic impacts of trade agreements and policy reforms. My work focuses on building institutional modeling capacity—designing analytical tools that stakeholders can use independently to simulate trade scenarios, evaluate negotiation positions, and inform policy decisions. This includes developing secure deployment frameworks for sharing economic modeling tools across agencies.

My technical expertise spans gravity modeling, general equilibrium simulations, Bayesian inference, and likelihood-based estimation. I am an experienced programmer in R and Julia, with modeling packages published on CRAN ([gravityGE](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gravityGE), [censoredAIDS](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=censoredAIDS)) and [JuliaHub](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/General/GravityGE). I deploy modeling tools using modern cloud infrastructure including Docker, AWS, Azure, Shiny Server, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD, ensuring secure and scalable access for end users.

My public-facing work includes the [U.S. Domestic Agricultural Trade Dashboard](https://noejnava2.shinyapps.io/us_ag_flows_gravityge/), an interactive tool for exploring interstate agricultural trade flows and simulating policy scenarios using gravity modeling with general equilibrium effects. Additional modeling tools developed for government clients are not public-facing; some include AI-powered interfaces that allow stakeholders to query results through natural language.

Beyond model development, I have delivered capacity building workshops and training events to help government officials and technical staff adopt these modeling tools effectively.

Previously, I served as a Research Agricultural Economist at the USDA Economic Research Service, where I developed models to analyze food systems and their implications for agricultural markets and farmer welfare. I also contributed to building an international agricultural baseline modeling tool that enables government agencies to evaluate policy proposals against long-term projections over 10–30 year horizons.

I hold a Ph.D. in Agricultural and Applied Economics from the University of Illinois.
