<!-- 05/16/2021 version -->

I am a Ph. D. student of applied economics at the University of Illinois. I am interested in studying Food Systems and their implications for environment and health with a focus in the NAFTA (now USMCA) region. I started a Ph.D. in applied economics as a member of the Regional Economics Applications Laboratory (REAL). Here, I strive to study empirical issues from a structural modelling approach to inform public policy. 

My current work as research assistant concerns interstate crop trade as a mitigating factor for the effects of climate change. I work with large datasets of climatological, land use and economic indicators regarding U.S. farmers' lands. My team is currently working on the estimation of domestic crop flows at the commodity disaggregation and county geographical level. I also work as intern for the USDA Economics Research Service's Market & Trade Economics Division. Here, I am working on studying the spatial non-stationarity impact of future and present weather on corn and soybean yields in the U.S.  

I am also experienced in estimation of price and income elasticities using AIDS and QUAIDS, counterfactual simulations using general equilibrium models of trade and input-output structural decomposition analyses with regional and multi-regional databases.

### My paper *Who benefits from local agriculture?* will be presented at the AAEA 2021 

Paper with prof. [William Ridley](https://ace.illinois.edu/directory/wridley) and prof. [Sandy Dall'Erba](https://ace.illinois.edu/directory/dallerba)

Advances in agricultural production and specialization have allowed some U.S. states to become net food exporters, while others have become net importers. Specialization requires using farming practices that the general public perceived as unhealthy and detrimental to the environment but necessary to achieve high output levels with limited resources; so, consumers' advocacy to shift food production back to local markets is gaining momentum. However, evidence suggests that allowing markets to rely on a few food production sources posits concerns about food vulnerability to droughts and floods. Improvements in the efficiency of food supply chains that reduce the cost of trade have been proposed to mitigate welfare losses caused by extreme weather events. I analyze consumers' food expenditure under these two opposing policy recommendations. I employ a Ricardian general equilibrium model for the U.S. domestic market of crops and find that welfare gains are higher under reduced costs of trade than under improved local agricultural productivity. The divergence in gains between each policy's welfare effects is driven by the benefits to net importers of food with low levels of agricultural production. Moreover, my results indicate that U.S. resilience against weather shocks is higher under the enhanced efficiency of food supply chains than under improved local agricultural productivity. In contrast to previous studies, my Ricardian application rules out non-market factors present in international trade studies. I present evidence that the U.S. market for crops is more suitable for this type of analysis than the international setting.

### I will be at NARSC 2020 presenting *Building resilience against weather shocks: Should we go local?*

I am a Ph. D. student of applied economics at the University of Illinois. I am interested in consumption and agricultural production with a focus in the NAFTA (now USMCA) region. Upon graduation from the CSU-San Bernardino, I spent a year working at the USDA for the Rural Development and National Agricultural Statistics Service branches. Then. I started a Ph.D. in applied economics as a member of the Regional Economics Applications Laboratory (REAL).

I consider myself a classic nerd with a math mentality. I constantly abstract myself from reality to generalize patterns and to find exceptions. I often say that I know my utility curves and strive to make rational decisions. There is no such thing as a homo-economicus, but on average and in the long run we all are fine people. I was raised in a small town in Mexico whose primary economic activity is food production. I started working at the age of 8 years old cleaning windows at my father's work. By the age of 14, I wrote an 100-page novel about a girl falling in love at a funeral (I will make sure it is never published!), and at the age of 20 drug cartel violence became intolerable that I left my studies to start a new life in California. Now I am 29 years old.
