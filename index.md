Model-based microeconomist studying food systems and their implications for farmers' welfare and human health.

I joined the USDA Economic Research Service as a research agricultural economist for the Agricultural Policy & Models Branch in the Market & Trade Economics Division. I hold a Ph.D. in Agricultural and Applied Economics from the University of Illinois, and a B.A. in Mathematical Economics from the California State University.

My work explores the opportunities and limitations of methodological advancements to accurately reflect food markets. I strive to understand how market assumptions have implications for the Mathematical modeling of consumers and producers. For this purpose, I employ computational methodologies such as Bayesian methods, specific-case parametrization of log-likelihood functions, and G.E. simulations to inform food policy. 

Outside economics, I am a geo-politics nerd (including non-fictional regions) who enjoys hiking and travel, and a podcast listener who walks from 4pm to 5pm every day. In Winters, I hibernate, but mostly I remote-work and play video games. Currently reading John Green's *The Anthropocene Reviewed: Essays on a Human-Centered Planet*.
#### I will be presenting my work on the poverty implications of the recent food price escalation in México, *Alleviating the poverty implications of the 2021 food price escalation in México*, at the AAEA 2022 in Anaheim, CA.

##### (Current) Abstract

México has experienced significant food price increases derived from supply chain disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to several households falling into poverty. This manuscript estimates a complete food demand system that accounts for the substitution effects across food items to accurately calculate the cost of a poverty alleviation policy tailored to the recent price escalation. Our findings reveal that during the year 2021, the price of food increased such that Mexican households require an additional 9% of biweekly expenditure to keep a level of welfare similar to that of the beginning of the year. Demographic comparisons reveal that households led by women were the most affected by the recent price increases regardless of income or whether the household is in an urban or rural area. We find that the cost of alleviating the poverty effects caused by the recent price escalation is $48.6 billion pesos ($2.4 billion dollars) for one year. Because we expect the price tag to be substantially high for a developing country, we group Mexican states by the level of income compensation required to distribute to each family and propose an efficient allocation of transfer payments.
