### Who benefits from local agriculture?

Paper with prof. [William Ridley](https://ace.illinois.edu/directory/wridley) and prof. [Sandy Dall'Erba](https://ace.illinois.edu/directory/dallerba).

Specialization in agriculture requires using farming practices that the general public perceive as unhealthy and detrimental to the environment. As a consequence, consumers' advocacy to shift food production back to local markets is gaining momentum. Based on a general equilibrium model of interstate crop trade, we conduct simulations to assess the impacts of different policies on the domestic food system. We analyze the welfare implications under a policy that improves local agricultural productivity. Then, we compare our results to those from an opposing policy recommendation that enhances food supply chains between U.S. states. The divergence between welfare impacts is driven by the benefits to net exporters of food with high levels of agricultural production. Our results suggest that policies that aim to improve local agricultural productivity may be regressive since they unambiguously benefit large agricultural producers.

### The Ricardian model with spatially varying impacts of climate change (submitted for publication consideration to the Review of Environmental Economics and Policy)

Paper with prof. [Sandy Dall'Erba](https://ace.illinois.edu/directory/dallerba), [Chang Cai](https://ace.illinois.edu/directory/ccai5) and prof. [A. Stewart Fotheringham](https://sgsup.asu.edu/stewart-fotheringham). Manuscript has been invited for publication consideration in the special issue on scale of the Journal of Geographical Systems.

The Ricardian framework has been widely used to study the impact of climate change on agriculture across US counties over the past few decades. While the spatial heterogeneity of climate change is well-accepted, the literature struggles to reach an agreement on how to model it, hence leading to a wide range of forecasted impacts. This paper employs Multiscale Geographically-Weighted-Regression (MGWR) to avoid setting an a priori definition of heterogeneity and to generate county-specific marginal effects of climate change impacts. We start with a cross-validation exercise that demonstrates the superiority of MGWR over previous specifications. The local parameter estimates derived from MGWR are then used to forecast changes in farmland value due to expected 2038-2070 climate conditions. Results reveal an expected national average loss in farmland value that is substantially larger than the losses predicted in previous studies. We attribute the divergence to unspecified heterogeneity that leads to a downward bias in farmland price forecasts. While previous studies find a large number of counties benefiting from climate change, our results indicate that only a total of 24 counties â€“ mostly in Texas - will experience gains. Our place-specific marginal effects will help guide the development of place-tailored mitigation and adaptation strategies to climate change.
