### Poverty implications of the 2021 food price escalation in México

Paper with with [Benjamin D.K. Wood](https://sites.google.com/view/bdkwood/) and [Rafael Garduño-Rivera](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ju4Y-EwAAAAJ&hl=en/).

México has experienced significant food price increases derived from supply chain disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to several households falling into poverty. In this manuscript, we estimate a complete food demand system that accounts for the substitution effects across goods to accurately calculate the poverty effects caused by the recent price escalation. Our findings reveal that during the year of 2021 the price of food increased such that Mexican households require an additional 9% of biweekly expenditure to keep a level of welfare similar to that of the beginning of the year. Demographic comparisons reveal that households led by women were the most affected by the recent price increases regardless of income or whether the household is in an urban or rural area. We find that the cost of alleviating the poverty effects caused by the recent price escalation is $48.6 billion pesos ($2.4 billion dollars) for a one-year period. Because we expect the price tag to be substantially high for a country like México, we group Mexican states by the level of income compensation required to distribute each family and suggest an efficient allocation of payment transfers.
### Tracing U.S. county-to-county domestic trade flows in grains

Paper with [William Ridley](https://ace.illinois.edu/directory/wridley) and [Sandy Dall'Erba](https://ace.illinois.edu/directory/dallerba).

Despite the critical importance of domestic trade in agriculture, available information on sub-national trade at detailed spatial scales remains limited. In this paper, we first describe the features of available primary data sources on interstate trade and the challenges that arise in working with such data. We then develop an approach to imputing US bilateral county-to-county shipments of agricultural products based on a gravity modeling framework using interstate trade data and county-level supply and demand characteristics, taking care to account for the deficiencies in the primary trade data. Finally, we present benchmarks comparing our constructed county-to-county trade dataset to other recently available datasets describing the sub-national movement of agricultural products in the United States. In tracing the universe of US shipments of agricultural products at a fine geographical resolution, our dataset will enable researchers to address a wide assortment of research questions on important issues relating to domestic trade patterns and food supply chain vulnerability.
